 * The split layout (spec §5.2, D31): the area under the status bar split into rows or columns, each

 * 0 is a cell; a split has its ratio in the low bits, and flags for columns and a hidden separator.
 * The cells' fields are the preset's slots, in the order the cells come. Pure C, host-buildable.
